It causes a great deal of stress as well as financial burden, and not all students are able to attend course events equally (review sessions, recitations, etc.). To help this I think encouraging the recording of such events would be greatly helpful. 7.Time management – At the start of my time at Tech my time management skills were not as good as some of my peers. While this is no longer an issue to me, I think the institute should advertise the services relating to this better (I know the services are available) 8.	Campus travel – Possibly more busses on each route, wait time is rather long. 9.Registration – Buzzport could be a bit more streamlined than it currently is in regard to registration. 10. Permits for large classes (overload) – While I am aware there are likely other challenges associated with issuing permits, I feel as if obtaining them is rather hard and for large classes they should be more easy to acquire since a few extra students likely would not affect the overall class"
